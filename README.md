# Your Cloud Server Organization

Welcome to **Your Cloud Server**! 👋

## About

This is the official `.github` repository for the Your Cloud Server organization. This special repository contains organization-wide configurations, community health files, and default settings that apply across all repositories in our organization.

## What is a .github Repository?

The `.github` repository is a special GitHub repository that allows organizations to:

- 📋 Define default community health files (CODE_OF_CONDUCT, CONTRIBUTING, SUPPORT, etc.)
- 🔄 Share workflow templates across multiple repositories
- 📝 Create organization-wide issue and pull request templates
- 🎨 Customize the organization profile that appears on GitHub
- ⚙️ Set default configurations for repository features

## Purpose

This repository serves as the central hub for:

- **Community Guidelines**: Standards and expectations for contributors
- **Workflow Templates**: Reusable GitHub Actions workflows
- **Issue & PR Templates**: Standardized templates for better communication
- **Organization Profile**: Public-facing information about Your Cloud Server
